<h2>ðŸ“„ Overview and Goal </h2>
<br><a> This project will analyse <b>all domestic flights that happen in the US from 2015 to 2018.</b> The goal is to compare the delay rate for the most relevant destination trip to the least likely to delay.<br><br>
The most relevant destination trip was decided by reviewing common travel blogs and specially <a href= "https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/02/2455472/0/en/The-Best-of-the-US-New-Study-Reveals-the-Most-Popular-Travel-Destinations-Among-Americans.html#:~:text=Hawaii%20and%20California%20dominate%20the,domestic%20travels%20and%2042%25%20Hawaii."> this portal</a>.
The least likely to delay destinations, however, were grouped upon data analysis on period of the year, day and origin. Once all the mentioned criterea were fully sharpned, we were able to understand how picking a hot destination would not necessarily impact on delay. <br><br>
That being said, we can conclude that flights in the US don't tend to delay very often. Regardless of their destination.
